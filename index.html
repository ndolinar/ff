            The combination of grand claims, lack of decent evidence and mentions of serious conditions moved me to make a few complaints to the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).  The organizations and practitioners that I complained about appear to have provided the ASA with what they consider to be ‘evidence’ which supports their position.

            The ASA has recently finished their assessment of the submissions made by promoters of Bowen Technique.  They sent me their conclusions, without the usual insistence on confidentiality (which I always respect).  So, in the spirit of letting potential consumers know how the ASA view these marketing claims, I’m providing a summary.

            At this point I’d like to make it clear that I don’t mind at all if people want to use the services of a Bowenist.  It’s entirely up to them how they spend their hard-earned cash.  However, I do think that it’s important that consumers have access to honest and truthful information, so that they can make a properly informed choice.

            On the other hand, I do take a very dim view of people who make unsubstantiated claims in order to sell their wares; especially when there is a chance that their marketing strategy could cause serious harm to their clients.
